Markov chain codes
Part A : 
Consider a Continuous-Time Markov Chain with finite states S = {0,1,2,...N) and some given transition matrix. Assuming the waiting time, 
H_i has an exponential distribution at rate $\lambda _{i}$. The input to the code is: (a) initial state, (b)
T, (c) transition probability matrix P which is an (N+1)x(N+1) matrix and (d) $\lambda _{i}$ for  for i = 0,1,2,...N. 
Output would be (a) $t _{j}$ switching times and (b) states at those times.
