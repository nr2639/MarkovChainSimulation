Markov chain codes
Part A : 
Consider a Continuous-Time Markov Chain with finite states S = {0,1,2,...N) and some given transition matrix. Assuming the waiting time, 
H_i has an exponential distribution at rate - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda&space;_{i}" title="\lambda _{i}" />  The input to the code is: (a) initial state, (b)
T, (c) transition probability matrix P which is an (N+1)x(N+1) matrix and (d) <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda&space;_{i}" title="\lambda _{i}" /> for  for i = 0,1,2,...N. 
Output would be (a) tj switching times and (b) states at those times.
